How much stationary goes missing from your office on average?As an employer have you ever looked into this?The reason I Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment write this is one of my employees told me today, he had 12 of my company branded pens at £2.50 per unit, at his house.Since I found this out it made me evaluate my stationary costs and consider what I spend…The first thing I looked at is if I have enough paper to print out his P45, thankfully I do.Secondly, I wanted to check I had enough ink cartridges to allow me to do the above.Finally, I did ask my employee to go home and get the pens, for me sign his dismissal letter.What has obviously gone missing from your office?
