Go on admitit you love receiving the odd compliment or three, but I bet you actually rememberany criticisms you may have received much more easily.

Well, beingaware of your challenges is important, however what it doesn’t do is helpimprove your performance. Instead criticism makes us retreat, put up defensesnot to mention corrode our confidence.

So how dowe deal with this? Make sure you always understand and capitalise on yourstrengths.

The result,by focusing on your strengths, you are likely to be far more engaged in yourjob and more likely to enjoy a better quality of life than those around you,who let those criticisms become stronger negatives, than the positives, whichare so much more rewarding.

So neverforget celebrating your strengths!
