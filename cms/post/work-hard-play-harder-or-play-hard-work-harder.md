This is something that many sales professionals seem to do, which is normally the driving force behind their success!

Everyone has some form of vice, this is something that effectively involves a blow out of some sort.

It is typical for a salesman to earn £5,000 per month and spend £7,000 or even more, this is not the recommended way as there does come a point where you will ultimately burn out, having said that from a Sales Manager point of view, it can be a dream if they get to work when they need to be there….

So, do you Play Hard and Work Harder or Work Hard and Play Harder?
