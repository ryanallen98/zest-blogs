What is the biggest thing in sales that stops you completing a deal?I appreciate that you want to get it right for your customer however, going into too much detail can have a [detrimental effect](#) I believe.It is, and will always be, a slight numbers game in my opinion. If you have the [right volume of output](#), some good will come of it.By saying this I don’t mean ‘[throw mud at the wall and see if it sticks!](#)’ Although naturally, there is a little bit of this throughout the sales cycle.Overthinking and assuming you totally know what is right can slow down the process, so much so that it can make it [come to a standstill](#).Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know if you agree or disagree…#Zest2Rec #OverThinking #Recruitment #MudAtTheWall #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment
