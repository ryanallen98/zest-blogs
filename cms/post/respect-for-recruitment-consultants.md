Do you need companies or do companies need you?

Let’s face it… the product in recruitment is the candidate. Therefore, if you have a strong enough talent pool, it should be that companies need you!

So why do we as recruitment companies let clients dictate to us?

The first thing that always comes up is, ‘your fees are too high?’

If this is the case then let the client go, there will always be another!

Secondly, if the company treats you like a service provider and nothing more… you probably need to find other clients as you are the recruitment arm for each company you represent.

Finally, stick to your terms as I can guarantee you the companies you deal with will not be flexible if the shoe was on the other foot!

I would be interested to hear thoughts from other recruitment consultants out there…
