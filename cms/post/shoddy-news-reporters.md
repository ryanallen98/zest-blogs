Do you really listen or believe the shoddy stories in the press?

If you do, then have you fallen for the trap they want you to fall into?

I mean they write what they want and make it up, then claim it’s true without any facts and it is perceived to be the truth.

It is like a company saying they are the World’s fastest growing business of its kind!

Really, well I suppose they could be, however how many times do you hear the same old stories…

It would be nice if the media published something original for once.

Or, maybe they should get some new columnists to write something different for a change.
