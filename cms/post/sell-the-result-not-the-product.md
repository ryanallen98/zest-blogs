We all like to sell our product or service, therefore sometimes forget about the result?If you focus on the result, then in theory it should sell itself?This allows the [customer to visualise](#) the benefits without having to sell to hard.We all hate it when a sales executive tries to [bash you over the head](#) on the phone, don’t we?So, before you pick up the phone today, or go to see a client face to face, [take a step back](#), think about what the result will be for the prospective client.At that point try and ‘SPIN’ your sale and see what happens…#Zest2Rec #SellTheResult #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
