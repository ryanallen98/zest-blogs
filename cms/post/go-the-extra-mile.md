Can you wholeheartedly say that you [go the extra mile](#) for your customers?If you do, make sure it is apparent as this in effect will retain the account.It is a dog eat dog World out there and [some of your competition](#), albeit not the right approach will aim to put down your service to win the contract.If you want to win a contract, it should be based on the [benefits of the service](#) you are offering and let’s face it, people really buy into you!So, moving forwards make sure your clients know what a good job you are doing…#Zest2Rec #GoTheExtraMile #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
