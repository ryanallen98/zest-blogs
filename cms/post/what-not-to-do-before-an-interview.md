We always hear what to do before an interview and I understand that however, how often do you hear about what **not** to do before an interview?I will keep it brief as I could go on all day and I would like to hear your thoughts on the below.

*   If you have no idea who the interviewer will be… [then be careful](#) with who you abuse on the way to the interview!
*   Try and avoid parking in the CEO’s space and then giving them the [middle finger](#) as you get out of your car.
*   Don’t use [terms of endearment](#) with the receptionist.
*   Leave your hoodie and headphones at home…
