If you’re not comfortable saying...

Thanks for correcting me I didn’t realise that.

I hadn’t thought of it like that, I understand now.

I was wrong about that and I’ve changed my mind.

I should do some more research before I argue my point.

Get comfortable, because there is no shame in being wrong.

There is, if you refuse to learn!
