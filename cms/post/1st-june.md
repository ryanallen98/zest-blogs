It is officially the [beginning of Summer](#) and the start of what should be a cracking month!However, each month is what you decide to make it…I would like you to be totally honest with yourself and see if you are ready?Will you sit back and put your feet up or [take the challenge](#) and throw yourself into it with full throttle.Whatever you decide to do, remember at the end of the month and second quarter of the year, the only person you can blame when it all falls apart is you!Take ownership now and not [next week or the week](#) after as everyday that goes by, could be a day that brings you closer to your goal…#Zest2Rec #1stJune #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
