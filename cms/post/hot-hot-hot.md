We have been so busy over the last few months and it has occurred to us this morning that we haven’t updated you all on the roles we are currently recruiting for!

As we approach November, lots of people are under the impression that things slow down in

recruitment and companies won’t actively look and/or interview candidates until the New Year.

However, in our case this is not true!

We currently have opportunities all over the globe including London, Middle East and Europe with most offering assistance with relocation or full relocation packages.

Our clients are established, reputable businesses offering real career opportunities for the right people with amazing earning potential…

We are currently looking to speak with Sales and/or Property professionals from any background or industry and all experience levels. We have entry level sales roles right up to sales director positions.

If you are considering a move, please do get in touch with us today! One of our team members can speak to you about current opportunities as well as future positions and give some overall career advice. You can get us on +44 (0) 1293 300 020 or [careers@zest2recruitment.com](mailto:careers@zest2recruitment.com).

We look forward to hearing from you!
