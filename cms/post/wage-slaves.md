Do you think [HR Professionals](#) are now redundant? From a recruitment point of view, do they just slow the process down?I could put in many procedures to make it seem like I should be paid for the work I do.Shall we just call them [‘wage slaves’](#) or [‘paper pushers’](#)… the list could go on forever!Ok… I understand the fact that if someone needs to leave employment in difficult circumstances then they have a [minor value](#) however, there isn’t really any use for them when it comes to recruitment.Only the [hiring managers](#) know what is right for their team as they are in the forefront of the day to day running of their department.Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know if HR Professionals are redundant or not…#Zest2Rec #HRRedundantOrNot #RajNasta #WageSlaves #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
