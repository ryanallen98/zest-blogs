Monday is upon us again and we’re wondering how many of you woke up and thought about the day in either of the [below directions](#)…

1.  I am willing to give everything I have today, I am determined to have a productive day.
2.  I am very skilled at what I do and it’s Monday, so it doesn’t matter if I have a slow start.

We began thinking about this and wondered if [complacency comes into play](#) more when someone is considered to be [highly skilled](#) and experienced… whereas on the other hand, someone who is new to something tends to be far more willing to learn, listen and [implement advice](#) which leads them to results.People can be taught the skill of something, like selling for example, there must be thousands of techniques and tips out there when it comes to closing a deal! Equally, some people can exhibit a [natural ability](#) towards something they may not have done previously.However, we believe it always comes down to whether or not somebody actually _wants_ to do it. You could be the best sales person in the world although, if you don’t want to pitch any prospects your product or service, then you aren’t going to get very far!_BUT_… if you are willing and determined to keep plugging away and continue to pitch prospects as much as possible then you will have [results returned](#) to you, irrespective of how ‘skilled’ you are in the [art of persuasion](#).Therefore, it seems simple enough and fair to say that… It’s the will, not the skill!#Zest2Recruitment #Zest2Rec #Recruitment #ItsTheWillNotTheSkill #MondayMotivation
