2.  Singing at your desk?
3.  The smell of cooked food?
4.  Clock watching?
5.  Finding yourself overly funny?
6.  Not being listened to?
7.  The use of mobile phones?
8.  Starting meaningless conversations?
9.  Having to be nice to people you hate?
10.  Bad odours?
11.  Load music?
12.  Talking excessively loud on the phone?
13.  The know it all’s?
14.  Constant mouse clicking?
