As a Recruiter… how many times do your clients ask you to ‘try before they buy?’They feel that once the candidate has been with their company for 3 months they will pay the invoice.Oh, and they tend to be a ‘large corporate’… so you will get paid!At what point do you say, ‘No! Our terms are not negotiable?’…Here at Zest 2 Recruitment, we tend to throw it back at our clients and say, ‘Can you send me your product? I will try it out for a month and if we don’t like it then will send it back without paying!’If it is a property developer or something similar on a large scale, then the statement we make is ‘Transfer the property deeds into my name and after 90 days, I will pay as I want to ‘try before I buy!’You can imagine the type of response I get every time, ‘You must be having a laugh…’Raj Nasta would like to know what you recruiters think…#Zest2Rec #TryBeforeYouBuy #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
