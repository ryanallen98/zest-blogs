#MondayMotivation has got us pondering on how to keep the tempo up when it seems winter has well and truly arrived!

The clocks have gone back an hour this weekend so although it isn’t so dark in the mornings, most of us still will have had the joyous task of scraping ice from our windscreens (and losing the feeling in our fingers as a result!)

However, when it is single figure temperatures outside, the office can have a certain lure with the promise of hot freshly-brewed coffee and the heating on full-blast!

Here at Zest 2 Recruitment, we want to know which tips and tricks our followers use to get themselves out of bed on a frosty morning?

Please like, share and comment! Let’s see how many useful (or strange!) tips we can compile together.
