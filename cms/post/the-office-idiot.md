Does every office have one? Now… you may not want to answer this if you only have 3 members of staff!However, the reality is you must have at one point in your career worked with an ‘office idiot’? If you feel you have never worked with the office idiot then it is probably you.How do you define an ‘Office Idiot’?People are different in many ways, some are super quick at picking things up whereas others just don’t seem to get it. You must have been in a situation where you have had to tell someone the same thing multiple times and then the next day you get asked the very same question.Does that make the person the so called ‘office idiot’ or, do we just accept that they have a plank of wood between their ears?So… Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know the answer, do you have an ‘office idiot’?#zest2rec #officeidiot #woodbetweenyourears #politicallycorrect #unpc
