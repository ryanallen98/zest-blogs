Remember the joys of flying when seatallocation was free?

Now, whichever airline you choose, be sure thatyour favourite seat is an added extra fee which will almost certainly leave youfeeling very woe is me.

As far as I can see, the cost of travelling nofrills just became extremely frilly to me!

So, to get the seat you want without a fee…you have to go to the airport and plea! Oh,

What has become of the good old days oftravelling truly ‘economy’?
