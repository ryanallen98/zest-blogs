The quote _‘Where there is shouting, there is no true knowledge’_ by the great Leonardo Da Vinci, has got us thinking this Monday at [Zest 2 Recruitment HQ](#)…As a Director, Manager or even a Team Leader… does shouting get the best results from your team?Many employees can probably remember a time they had the pleasure (or not!) of working with a senior member of staff who likes to get their point heard by [raising their voice](#), particularly within a sales environment!However, does this work? Or does it make individuals switch off to you?Perhaps instead of shouting and becoming agitated with poor performances, being able to offer some ideas of [how to improve results](#) as well as some constructive criticism could be a more effective way of motivating staff and lifting spirits… which would ultimately lead people to their own successes.Shouting above everyone else does not necessarily [encourage people to work harder](#) or mean that [your opinion has the most value](#)… if what you have to say is knowledgeable, constructive, supportive and encouraging then this can be done in a whisper!We would be keen to find out your thoughts… (and please do feel free to share your stories of monstrous managers, past and present!)#Zest2Recruitment #Zest2Rec #Recruitment #Sales #Shouting #MondayMotivation
