This is always a fun subject to talk about as everyone [likes to have airtime](#), however at what cost?It can almost get to a point whereby you know you may as well [agree to disagree](#), or do you keep the battle going.I suppose if you are emotionally involved then it is hard to take a step back, having said that if you take your personal feelings out of the conversation, this will enable you to make pragmatic decisions.So, when you next have a [battle of wills](#), do you have this conversation with or without emotion?#Zest2Rec #BattleOfWills #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
