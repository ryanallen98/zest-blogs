This is a topic we have been thinking about here at [Zest 2 Recruitment](#) over the last couple of days. We speak to many candidates and clients each day and generally speaking, they tend to be very [confident personalities.](#)However, does confidence sometimes get mistaken for arrogance? Confident would be a complimentary way of someone else describing you… [arrogant as a description](#) maybe not so much!Remember… _“Arrogance is a cowboy that tells… Confidence is a cowboy that shows.”_ We are keen to know what others think about this subject and [hear some scenarios](#) whereby your confidence may have been mistaken for arrogance. Please like, share and comment!#Zest2Rec #Zest2Recruitment #Zest2Rec #RajNasta #ConfidenceOrArrogance #Recruitment
