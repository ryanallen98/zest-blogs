I interviewed a candidate for a Sales Executive role recently... my first question was, ‘why have you had 5 jobs in the last 18 months?’The answer I got was, ‘I need to walk my dog for 30 minutes during the day and it takes me an hour to get to and from work!’So, [this led me to ask](#), ‘if there was traffic, how long would it take you to do this round trip?’The candidate responded with... ‘it could take up to one and a half or two hours and I only have one hour for a lunch break!’My next thought was surely the candidate has considered other options such as a dog walker...‘No!’ said the candidate, ‘[my dog isn’t trained](#), and he often runs off, so it can take over an hour to find him!’Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know... what is the [most comical reason](#) you have heard as to why someone can’t hold their job down?#Zest2Rec #ClassicAnswers #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
