Do we live in a World whereby we don’t say what should be said, I mean in School these days a teacher is not allowed to reprimand kids like in the old days?I remember the good old [corporal punishmen](#)t days, if I were to be rude to a teacher it was simple, I had the choice of the dreaded ‘slipper’ or ‘cane!’So, do we let members of staff push the limits so much to the point that, [aggressive behaviour](#) becomes normality?Corporal punishment taught you respect in others and I think today, or should I say in the past few decades we allow the [younger generation](#) to constantly blame others!So, if someone was born in an earlier generation and they are acting like this, what excuse would they have today?#Zest2Rec #CorporalPunishment #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
