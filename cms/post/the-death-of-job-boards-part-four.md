Recycling of jobs and candidates is basically what you get when you subscribe to an online Job Board!You may think you are getting the [unique quality](#) that is promised… as I have many times in the past. However, the facts remain that all you get is the same old.So, if you compare this to your [recycling bin](#) at home, it tends to have the same system. You throw it in the caddy, it gets taken away to a main centre and then sent back a year or two later in another form. In the Job Board comparison, it comes back maybe a little more experienced.All you need to do in the first place is recycle yourself by using [your own database](#), keep in touch with the said candidate and you will get the same result at a minimum fee! Now I’m pretty sure you don’t pay £1,000 per month to your council to take away your recycling, do you?Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know what you think about [online Job Board](#) recycling?#Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment #Zest2Rec #RajNasta #JobBoards #Recycling #TakeTheTrashOut
