[‘Honesty is the best policy’](#) is a very tentative subject! Especially when selling products or services as you do need to highlight the [benefits of your product](#) however, at what cost?...So many [Sales Professionals](#) think too much about the target they need to achieve therefore, leading them to be swayed into mis-selling.The facts are the facts! If they are presented in the right way and will potentially benefit the customer, then it should be simple enough to [close the sale](#)!However, if something is sold in a dishonest fashion… it only results in a [train wreck](#).There should never be a need to be [dishonest when selling](#)… don’t you agree?#Zest2Rec #HonestyIsTheBestPolicy #RajNasta #Recruitment
