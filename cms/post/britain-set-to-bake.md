The weather today, and the promise of heatwaves over the next week or so, has definitely given us our [#MondayMotivation](#) at [Zest 2 Recruitment.](#)The overall chirpiness of our candidates, clients and even neighbours has been somewhat brighter than if it were a grey and grizzly Monday which got us thinking… should we all be making hay whilst the sun shines? (Pardon the pun!)As there is a noticeable difference in us Brits mood because of all these UV’s, then surely it should be a great time to [capitalise on sales](#). Naturally in Britain, we tend to be in better spirits whilst the weather is warm (probably because it doesn’t happen often!) and when is there a better time to [close a deal](#) than when your prospects are happy?!Be mindful that lots of people will ultimately try and escape the office early come Friday afternoon in favour of a beer garden to soak up some [Vitamin D](#) so make sure every call and pitch that’s made is as scorching as the sun!Have a momentous week everyone, and don’t forget the factor 50…#Zest2Recruitment #Zest2Rec #Recruitment #MondayMotivation #BritainSetToBake #Heatwave
