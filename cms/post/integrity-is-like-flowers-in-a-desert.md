Integrity Is Like Flowers In A Desert…

People who can’t communicate, think everything's an argument.

Never argue with a fool, people watching won’t be able to tell the difference.

A person playing a role will eventually forget their act.

All the world's a stage and most of us are desperately unrehearsed.

Integrity is everything.

Pay attention!
