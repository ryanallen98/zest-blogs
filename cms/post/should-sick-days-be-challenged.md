Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would be interested to hear your views on sick days from both an employer and an employee point of view.So when someone calls in sick at one of the busiest times of the year and you have no cover with a very large client on site… what do you say to the employee? Is it acceptable to question if they are really sick?If you choose to challenge this are you being a harsh employer? Or are you expected to be a more sympathetic employer by saying “it’s fine… take the day off and get yourself better.”?We want to find out if you are doing employees any justice by saying it’s ok as this might be spreading the sick culture message. Also, do we think that employees should still attempt to get into work when they are poorly and do as much as they can before they have to surrender? By not even attempting to get to work, are you setting yourself up for a harsher response?On the other hand and from an employee’s point of view, should you be questioned about the fact that you are really sick or should you be able to just send a message and not be challenged?Do you expect your employer to simply say, “no issues and get well soon.”?We are interested to hear thoughts and opinions on this from both sides so please be encouraged to like, share and most of all comment!#Zest2Rec #Recruitment #SickDays #DuvetDays #GetToWork
