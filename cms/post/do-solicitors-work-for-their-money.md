Are they proactive or just totally and [utterly reactive](#), sorry I meant useless?How do they justify charging such [high fees](#) for not really doing a lot!From dealing with many in the past I have found that I tend to do most of the chasing, so much to the point that I feel I could probably do a better job…The facts remain that [solicitors are useless](#)!Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know who shares my view on these overpaid 'professionals’, oops I meant to say ‘unprofessionals’….#Zest2Rec #SolicitorsAreCrap #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
