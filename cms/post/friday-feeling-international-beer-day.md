So, before we turn our computers off and shut the office for the weekend, let’s recap what you have achieved so far.

1.  For this week have you met your sales target?
2.  From a new business point of view, how many clients have you won?
3.  Do you feel you have given your clients the best quality service?
4.  Have you have superseded your own expectations?

if you have said yes to these questions or at least most of them, you are in for a treat. It turns out today 3rd August is international beer day, so why not treating yourself to a pint or two.

However, if you have said no to them, perhaps it’s time for a change?
