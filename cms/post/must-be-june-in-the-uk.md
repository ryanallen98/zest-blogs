The second weekof June and you’ve arrived, and here we are the third day, the weathermen sayyou’re determined to stay, and all with Wimbledon just a few weeks away, couldyou come back some other day!

Despite thedownpour we’ll continue on our way, soggy but not defeated we will work andplay cos after all this is the UK!

So, pull onyour raincoats, put up your umbrellas, and keep moving to the sound of therains beat, all whilst splashing about with your wet feet!

At the endof the day we’ll be ok cos we’re all singing and dancing in the rain!
