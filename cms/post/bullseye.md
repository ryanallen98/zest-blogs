Raj Nasta – MD of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know… how many of you missed your last month’s target?If so, what was the reason for this? Are you already giving up the ghost as Halloween and the Christmas holidays begin to take over?Those working on a [quarterly target](#) will now have the chance to make it up…It is so important to keep going as Christmas approaching means that many industries have a quieter month in [December](#).So, what are you going to do to make it happen?! It is only down to you and you cannot start the [blame game](#) this early!Get in early perhaps. Leave later than usual… it’s dark at 5:30pm anyway! Work through your lunch and take some ownership of [your own destiny](#), if you haven’t already.If you get to the end of another month and you are in the same position, then as mentioned earlier, you only have yourself to blame…#Zest2Rec #MissingTargets #RajNasta #Recruitment #Zest2Recruitment #Bullseye
