Did you know thatSt Patricks day is the one national holiday thatis celebrated in more countries around the world than any other? Unfortunately,it’s not a public holiday in England, although perhaps it should be! Thisweekend many cities will be enjoying their St Patrick’s Day celebrations markedby lots of fun and spectacular events so it’s no wonder that St Patrick isone of the most popular saints!

Thisweekend whether your searching for that green Shamrock shirt, scanning socialmedia or (easy) Corned Beef recipes or picking up a little whiskey or thatother famous Irish drink here’s some funfacts to get the part started!

*   The first St.Patrick’s Day celebration in the United States was held in Boston (1737).

*   Did you know that theoriginal St Patrick’s Day colour was blue? It’sbelieved that the it was changed to green because of Ireland’s nickname “TheEmerald Isle,” and of course the green in the Irish flag along with theshamrock, or clover.

*   Back in 1962 markedthe first time Chicago dyed their river green for St Patrick’s Day, thistradition has continued as Chicago still dyes the river green for a few days!

*   Shamrocks are thenational flower/emblem of Ireland.

*   Legend says that eachleaf of the clover has a meaning: Hope, Faith, Love and Luck. Sadly, the oddsof you finding a four-leaf clover are about 1 in 10,000, so you’ll need some ofthat Irish good luck!

*   The world’s shortestSt. Patrick’s Day parade is held in an Irish village. It lasts only 100 yards,between the village’s two pubs.

And with Ireland playing in the sixnations against Wales on Saturday, this years’ St Patricks day may just be thebest yet!

Happy St Patricks Day everyone!
