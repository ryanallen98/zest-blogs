How many times have you heard the below statements?

*   I can’t do it
*   It can’t be done
*   It wont work

Having this type of defeatist attitude means you havealready lost! It will also, most likely stop you from doing what ever it is youare trying to do!

It is very simple… if you believe you can do something, youare probably most of the way there.

Let’s look at this from a sales perspective. If you pick upthe phone thinking you will get the sale, you have much more chance of actuallygetting the sale.

So, in future let’s not say ‘can’t’ use ‘can’ instead…
