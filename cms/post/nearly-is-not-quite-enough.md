Are we nowadays too accommodating to people ‘nearly’ reaching their goals? I mean in sport these days within schools, they don’t have [winners and losers…](#) they say it is all about taking part!I think we can all agree that life isn’t like this at all! In fact, it is quite the [opposite…](#)So, do you just accept that nearly getting there is enough? Or do you accept that nearly is not quite enough?Another way to look at it is what does a target mean to you? Is it [something to strive for](#) or is it a [minimum standard?](#) I think you will know my answer if you have read any of my previous blogs!I think I have said enough and I would now be keen to know your thoughts…#Zest2Rec #NearlyIsJustNotEnough #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
