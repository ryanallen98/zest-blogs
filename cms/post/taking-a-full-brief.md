Before you take on a contract, make sure you take a detailed brief.If you don’t, who is at fault, [you or the client?](#)As a service provider I believe you [must take control](#) and get this detailed brief.This is a very simple process and normally makes life easier for everyone.Most paying customers have an idea, or they think they do and don’t know how to implement it, which is why you are there in the first place….#Zest2Rec #TakingABrief #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
