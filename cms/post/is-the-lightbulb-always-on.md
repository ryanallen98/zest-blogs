This is a very good question and doesn’t apply to everyone I feel.How many times do you tell a member of staff the same thing [over and over again?](#)So much to the point that you must question whether they have a [plank of wood](#) between their ears?What do you do to fix this, keep [repeating yourself](#) or explain it differently?Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know if you have someone in the office whose light is always off…#Zest2Rec #LightBulbAlwaysOn #RajNasta #Zest2recruitment #Recruitment
