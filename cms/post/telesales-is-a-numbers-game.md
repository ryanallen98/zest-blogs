No matter how good you are in telesales, or even how good you think you are, the facts will always remain the same, telesales is and always will be a numbers game!Let’s look into this in more detail….You make 10 calls and manage to generate a sale which means you have hit your daily target.It’s only 1pm and you still have until 5pm to make calls, so do you sit back with your feet up or get onto the next call!Surely the answer is obvious as the more calls you make, the more sales you will achieve.Take recruitment as an example, you book 5 interviews in a week of which 2 convert to offers and then one accepts, if you had 10 interviews in a week then this would potentially you will have 4 offers and 2 placements.It’s not rocket science, so all you telesales executives out there need to make more calls.#Zest2Rec #NumbersGame #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
