It is almost the end of the month and payday again. However, we do still have a week or more to go so surely, you should be making sure you budget accordingly!Or… are you going to go out this weekend and blow your [last pennies](#) and not be able to get to work without an advance? It can’t be fun calling your manager on a Monday morning and asking to borrow the bus fare!Is it time to [‘Walk the Talk’](#) and start budgeting properly as any serious business-minded person should be doing. Surely if you want to be taken seriously, you need to be able to get yourself to work on time, looking sharp and at least be able to buy yourself a sandwich or offer your director/s a coffee?This also comes back to the point of ‘acting as if’ in this quote by [Jordan Belfort](#). - _“Act as if! Act as if you're a wealthy man, rich already, and then you'll surely become rich. Act as if you have unmatched confidence and then people will surely have confidence in you. Act as if you have unmatched experience and then people will follow your advice. And act as if you are already a tremendous success, and as sure as I stand here today -_ [_you will become successful._](#)_”_Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment wants to know if you agree or disagree.
