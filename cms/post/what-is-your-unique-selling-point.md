How have you come up the conclusion that this is your USP? Is it something along the lines of… [‘describe yourself in one word’?](#)I have asked this question many times over the years and some of the answers I receive are so basic. It sometimes [makes you wonder](#) if you are even talking to a sales professional!Most people say [typical clichés](#) like confident, motivated or tenacious. However, are these unique selling points about someone or simply what you would like to think you are?Raj Nasta would say my USP is I am very infectious… what would yours be?#Zest2Rec #UniqueSellingPoint #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
