Are we currently in a [candidate driven market](#)?Does this now mean employers need to do more to secure the right calibre of staff?Yes, is the answer. As the current market means that [job seekers](#) have a vast choice of opportunities, I think employers need to act quickly and sell their company if they like someone at interview.I had this conversation with a client last week saying, ‘I don’t need to [sell my company](#) as it is down to the candidate to sell themselves to me?’This doesn’t work in my opinion as it is and always has been a [two-way street](#), coupled with the fact that employers that do sell their companies, find they get the best staff.Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know if it is a candidate driven market or company driven market?#Zest2Rec #candidatedrivenmarket #Recruitment #JobBoards #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment
