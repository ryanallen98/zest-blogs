It is a new week and the first full working week of the [new month](#), so it is time to prepare your [much-needed phones calls!](#)The phone won’t pick up itself as I have said many times before however, before you do, think about the following…

1.  Plan your opening statement – it must have a meaning to the client.
2.  Don’t talk to much about trivial things, have a purpose for the call.
3.  Ensure you know all about the product or service you are selling.
4.  Ask decent open questions and have control throughout the call.
5.  Whatever you do, do not be afraid to ask for the business.

Just remember the [worst thing](#) that can happen is the client says ‘NO!’If you are dreading making those calls because you have [lost faith in the company](#) and/or product then give [Zest 2 Recruitment](#) a call now and let us help you get back to awesome!#Zest2Recruitment #Zest2Rec #Recruitment #HappyMonday #PhoneLionOrPhoneMonkey
