How many [companies want it all](#)? However, don’t want to pay for it! Remember the saying… ‘if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.’You always hear the same thing time and time again, ‘we have the best set up, the most amazing leads, we pay the [best commission in the market](#) however, we won’t give you a basic as all this costs so much money’…As a salesman myself, I will always go for [high commission](#) over big basics so the first question I would ask is how much the top sales executive is earning!Now, if the answer were to be something like [£5k-£10k per month](#) then I may consider listening. Having said that, most of the time the answer is that they have just started and have heavily invested in the company so, they only want money hungry, target driven individuals who don’t expect a basic at all.This is all very well although, the facts remain that if you [believe in your own company](#) then surely you should offer something? Even if it’s only lunch and travel money.Raj Nasta of [Zest 2 Recruitment](#) would like to know what all you serious sales professionals think out there?#Zest2Rec #PeanutsMonkeys #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
