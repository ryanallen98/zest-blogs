How many of you out there have had a no show this year without even a call? Whether it be for an interview or the start date of their new role.What makes new starters not turn up on their first day?We have been pondering the many reasons why candidates may have decided to not arrive on the first day but we still cannot seem to deem this acceptable. Maybe they had a counter offer and decided to stay where they were, maybe they got cold feet and decided the grass probably isn’t greener or perhaps we, as Recruitment Consultants, need to look a bit closer to home.Did we keep in touch with our candidates enough after the offer stage and ensure that any doubts or questions were dealt with?On the other hand, could it be that they are just gutless and have no respect for anything? They have decided not to start and that’s it… they simply do not feel it is necessary to inform anyone.Many Recruitment Consultants must agree that this has to be one of the most frustrating and disappointing scenarios we could encounter! So, Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment, would be interested to hear your thoughts. Why does this happen and should it be accepted as part and parcel of our role?Please like, comment and share our blog. As always, if you’re a candidate looking for a new role or a business looking for staff, please do not hesitate to call one of the team on 01293 312 065.#Zest2Rec #Recruitment #Blogs #NoShows #CandidateDisappearance
