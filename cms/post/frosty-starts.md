I’m sure we can all agree that the temperature has [definitely dropped](#) over the last few days and this got us thinking at Zest 2 Recruitment HQ… do the chilly mornings make a difference to our productivity?Do you feel less motivated when its dark outside [when you wake up?](#) Does seeing the frost make you think you are better off staying in bed?Or… do the colder mornings motivate you to [smash out your day?](#) After all, quarterly bonuses could mean you could invest in a car with heated seats and a heated windscreen!Raj Nasta and the team believe that [rain or shine](#), hot or not, shouldn’t impact our day. Perhaps we should be so focused on getting into the office and owning the day that we didn’t even realise the weather! If you used the time spent on discussing how cold it has suddenly got into contacting a prospective client… that could be another yes!Let us know your thoughts on this icy topic… please like, comment and share!#Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment #Zest2Rec #RajNasta #FrostyStarts #Frozen #LeaveTheWeatherToTheMET
