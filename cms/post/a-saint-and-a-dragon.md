Happy St George’s day! Today is the one day of the year, apart from major football and rugby tournaments, when you are guaranteed to see English flags flying proudly across the country.

St George is most famously forever consigned to legend, as being the soldier in the Roman army who killed a dragon and saved a princess! We’re not sure how many dragons will be slain today but in the words of another famous George (Bernard Shaw) "People who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it”.

Happy St George’s day and do watchout for those dragons!
