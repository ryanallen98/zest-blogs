So, don’t be a tool and make sure you’renobody’s fool. Rather be the prankster or the jokes will be on you!  

Here’s to a day of fooling all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time,but almost certainly you won’t fool all the people all of the time!

However, jokers beware, when the clock strikes 12noon make sure there are no more crazy, improbable and fun things to do or elseyou’ll be the one and only lonely fool!
