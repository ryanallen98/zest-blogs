Would you say that most [technical minds](#) lack practicality?I have been looking at this in more detail having recently spoken to my IT department about our [WIFI speed being slow](#) and why this may be...The first question I asked was, ‘As the router is on the floor and behind a desk, surely this will influence the speed?’“Yes, it should be on the desk or on a wall” is the answer I got. So, we arranged for it to be hung on a wall and amazingly… it almost trebled in speed when I completed an Internet speed test!My IT department said of course it would [increase the speed](#)…Now, I class myself as a practical person, so if I were the Technical Team… I would have already done this and [would not have needed to be asked](#).Therefore, does technical ability sometimes forfeit simple [practicality](#)? We would love to hear your thoughts…#Zest2Rec #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment #Technical #Practicality #HaveYouTriedTheObvious
