Now I understand that all of you [sales professionals](#) out there will almost always think you cannot be defeated!Although, there is a point when you must [admit defeat](#) to enable yourself to progress…In doing this, are you saying you have failed? Or are you saying you are now ready for the next level?This is such an important factor not only in sales, but in [general life](#) and there must be a point where you just put closure to a situation.So… is admitting defeat being defeated?#Zest2Rec #AdmitDefeat #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
