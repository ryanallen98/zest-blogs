This is something I have heard many times over the years and it makes me laugh every time.Albeit a cheesy line, you must think if someone is making such a bold statement, there must be some truth in it, or you would like to think so…So, what makes someone a ‘serial closer?’Is it someone who is closing business on a day to day basis?Or, is it a person that just does it even out of work, just a natural thing that is done without thinking?I think I should leave this answer to all you well-rounded sales experts in the field…#Zest2Rec #SerialCloser #RajNasta #Recruitment
