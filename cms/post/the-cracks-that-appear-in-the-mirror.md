Do you look in the ‘[mirror](#)’ before you leave for work?Are you totally happy with what you see, or do you ‘[read](#)’ into it too much?If you do, then you may [start to believe](#) what is in front of you!It is quite simple in my humble opinion, only believe in what you know and not what you think you see.Everyone reads into things differently, yet only few can ‘read’ [between the cracks…](#)#Zest2Rec #CracksInTheMirror #RajNasta #Recruitment #Zest2Recruitment
