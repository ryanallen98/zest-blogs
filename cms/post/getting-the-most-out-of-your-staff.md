Do you as a Company think you get more out of your staff by not giving them breaks, making them work 60 hours week instead of 40?This is a good question and comes down to the fact that if your team are [trained correctly](#), they should in theory be able to do their job within a reasonable timeframe…Maybe even go down the route of getting a [table football machine](#), or pool table to give them some fun in the working environment like some of the large Corporates do!This has been proven to [increase productivity](#) and in turn means you have a happy, yet super productive place of work and more importantly, where your team want to be.I would like to hear anyone’s thoughts on this?#Zest2Rec #Productivity #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
