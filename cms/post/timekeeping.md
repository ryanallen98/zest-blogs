How flexible should you be as an employer when it comes to timekeeping?Do you need to have one rule for all? Or be [a bit more flexible](#) depending on individual circumstances?This is extremely tentative, particularly when it comes to new starters, as surely on [your first day](#) you should be early and not have the typical excusesâ€¦Most of the reasons for being late are not viable as if you want to be [somewhere on time](#), you will be!Do you as employer set a standard by just being brutal as a rule, or do you get more out of your staff by being a little bit flexible?#Zest2Rec #Timekeeping #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
