If you have made a mistake within a [client services environment](#), then this is generally understandable… depending on how you deal with the aftermath!However, if you clearly cannot accept it and deal with it like a grown adult then maybe you should change careers.Nobody likes to [admit](#) when they are wrong however, sometimes it is the only way to make things right.So, some general advice to all you customer service providers out there…Things do go wrong and on occasions this is out of your control. Don’t try and [blame others](#) and brush it under the carpet, as all this does is antagonise the situation.Take ownership and accept it! Then you will normally end up with a [happy customer](#) as you would have dealt with the situation appropriately.#Zest2Rec #CustomerServices #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
