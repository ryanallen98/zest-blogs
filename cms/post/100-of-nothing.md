I’m sure you have all heard the saying, ‘would you like 50% of something or 100% of nothing?’This is so true and too many people want it all, when having ‘[less of more](#)’ is surely the way forward?Do most of us out think that it is beneficial to be a [force unto our own](#) or does having more partners involved therefore, having a smaller slice of the cake, make you stronger?There are many [mixed reviews](#) on this as finding the right partner can be tricky, particularly if you don’t share the same views!I can’t give you the right answer to this question however, what I can say is, I would rather a smaller chunk of something then a large piece of nothing…Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know what you would prefer?#Zest2Rec #100%OfNothing #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
