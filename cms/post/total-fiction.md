This could be aimed at many things. However, the facts remain that most of what you see from [typical columnists is total fiction](#)!I suppose those seedy, [jumped-up journalists](#) need to make themselves feel better daily as frankly, all they do is elaborate the truth, normally write about another reporter with a fake name and then put in their [trashy newspaper](#) to get paid for itâ€¦Blimey! What a way to make a deceitful living. This should be stopped as I understand we all have freedom of speech but, facts should be what they base their sleazy stories on!So, should these [shoddy reporters](#) be allowed to get away with this?#Zest2Rec #FactNotFiction #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
