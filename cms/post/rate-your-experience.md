This week’s [#WednesdayWisdom](#) has got us thinking about Customer Services and what simple things make a good Customer Service experience…We all know the obvious points and things all businesses should do such as going the extra mile and being polite however, this is a lot easier to do with the clients/customers that you have a great [business relationship](#) with.So… what about the tricky ones? Or perhaps they aren’t [tricky](#), and you just have differing ideas and ways of conducting business.If you don’t always see eye to eye, does this mean that you should accept a [lesser expectation](#) of good Customer Service?Or is it up to us to challenge the service we are receiving and make sure that professionalism shines through from all angles… regardless of the [quality of the relationship](#)?Remember… a smile is free and good manners cost nothing!#Zest2Recruitment #Zest2Rec #Recruitment #CustomerServices #MannersAreFree
