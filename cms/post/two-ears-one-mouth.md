Who has heard the expression ‘two ears one mouth’?How many times do you get a [bulldozer of a salesman](#) on the phone and they’re just not letting you talk?I suppose the thought that must be going through their head is, ‘[If I talk enough](#)… someone will buy!’This is so [far away from the truth](#)! All you really need to do is ask questions, wait for a few seconds and guess what? You will get a response.Most of the time when you are with a client, you only need to ask them about themselves and you normally [can’t stop them talking](#).Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to hear your thoughts on the following question…If you are in a meeting for 60 minutes, how many of those minutes should you be talking compared to your client? …Please like, share and comment with your views.#Zest2Rec #TwoEarsOneMouth #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
