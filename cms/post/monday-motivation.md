Whilst driving into the office this morning, with the window open and the music relatively loud, I noticed that I was looking forward to getting my day started…Why? Well, as we all know, [Monday is a fresh start!](#) A new day, a new week and a new chance to achieve the work goals you have set yourself.However, I wonder if everyone feels this way or has it become customary to moan about Monday and dwell on the tasks in hand?Let’s not forget that we are now at the beginning of a new month as well as entering the last quarter of 2017. Surely, [switched-on Sales Professionals](#) should be thinking about chipping away at their target with the peaks and troughs of the months to come in mind.December is notoriously quieter, due to [the C word](#) that shan’t be mentioned, so you need to be considering this when forecasting your figures for October and November.Therefore, we want to know… how do you plan your time to incorporate the downtime that occurs over the next few months and ensure a target smash? We believe a factor is being motivated right at the very start… Monday morning!Share your thoughts with us, please like and comment!#Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment #Zest2Rec #RajNasta #MondayMonday #MondayMotivation #PickUpThePhoneAndStartDialling
