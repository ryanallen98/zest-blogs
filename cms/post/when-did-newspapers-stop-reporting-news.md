Fake news orjust tabloid fodder, reporting at best on D-list celebrities, just when did thequality of British newspapers become so dire? I know many of you are thinkingwhen did they ever report decent news full stop?  Gone are the days when Sunday mornings begunby a slow read through the broadsheets – mainly, due to print cutting coststhey now resemble every other red top or gossip pushing comic! And if you fancybrowsing online, you have to subscribe! Perhaps that’s where editors are hiding all the good news.

I read a goodcross section of newspapers the other day, with some small hope of actuallygetting to grip with what’s really happening in the world – unrealistic I know!

So where dowe go for the truth? Perhaps Mars?
