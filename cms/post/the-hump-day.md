Is Wednesday really the worse day of the week or otherwise known as ‘the hump day?’Well, I think it is really down to your mindset, as surely having 60% of the week to go this is now the time to [pull your socks up](#) and get to work.If you haven’t already done so, then wait no longer as [nothing comes to those who wait](#).Equally, if you think you have done everything you need to, then you are so wrong as you can always do more.Doing more when you are at the [top of your game](#) will only inspire others and assist you to achieve your aspirations.So, what are you going to do on this so called [‘hump day?](#)’#Zest2Rec #Hump Day #RajNasta #WednesdayWisdom #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
