How often have you been tempted to blame someone orsomething else for a mistake you’ve made?

At some point, we’ve all done it… even if it’s just a teenyweeny little white lie! However, the bottom line is the truth will always comeout. So, no matter how bad a situation is, be bold, be brave and above all beresponsible for the bad stuff that happens to you!

After all, we never hesitate to be responsible for the goodthings that happen to us, nor do we hesitate to shout from the rooftops “heylook at me, look how successful I am!”

Everyone’s a loser in the blame game so don’t play it,instead always strive to be responsible, to be accountable and work be incomplete control of your life.

Trust us, you’ll feel great.
