Well, we all like to _think_ we are Superhuman and can [party all weekend](#)! Maybe this is the case sometimes, although your body does start to say ‘NO!’At this point you need to start making some [life decisions](#) as to how hard you hit it whilst being off…Think about the following:How long do you think it will take your [body to recover](#), take that time and then double it! If you are on your second night, maybe treble it… you get the theme I hope.You’re in control of your own actions, so act today and [don’t make excuses](#) anymore…#Zest2Rec #SuperHuman #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment #DrinkAllDayPartyAllNight
