Having started in sales in the 80’s when nobody had emails and then in 2000 it transpired that 80% of my clients still didn’t have emails! Business was done either over the phone or face to face, I now find sales consultants thinking that business can be done mainly via emails….Ok, I get that emails are a good form of agreeing a contract, confirming conversations, sending out mailshots, etc, however nothing beats picking up the phone and talking to your client.Why do sales people think that the job can be done via email, normally because they are either too lazy or afraid of being told ‘NO!’Well if that is the case, ‘GET OUT OF SALES!’ as it cannot be done only via email.If we could just sell via emails, we would all be millionaires by now and even have a robot doing the job.I Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know if you think ‘PHONE OR EMAIL?’#phonevemail #zest2rec #pickupthephone #lazysalespeople #rajnasta
