Is most of what you read in the news [totally and utterly fake](#)? Mainly due to the fact that reporters will only write what they want anyway. Normally, this is about as far away from the truth as they can go!Sometimes they have an [alias](#) and write a story about them....So, why are they allowed to get away with it?What laws are there to protect people from this slander, which is totally legal? Surely a reporter should have to get the total facts before publishing a [made-up story](#).Should this be allowed or not? We want to know your thoughts and opinions so please like, share and comment.#Zest2Rec #FakeNews #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment #TodaysTrashYesterdaysNews
