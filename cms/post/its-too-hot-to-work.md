Unless you are one those people.We as business owners cannot [control the weather](#), however we can take certain steps to make our staff comfortable in the workplace.If you are in a suited environment and don’t have the luxury of air-conditioning, let your team come in on these hot day in a [more casual fashion](#), all this will do is increase productivity.Some of you may disagree and frankly I don’t care…#Zest2Rec #TooHotToWork #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
