Thinking you can do something means you have almost got there or in essence, you will be able to get there quicker. I’m sure plenty of sales professionals would have heard the ‘Act As If’ mantra and of course, the quote from Jordan Belfort after many screenings of The Wolf Of Wall Street._“Act as if! Act as if you're a wealthy man, rich already, and then you'll surely become rich. Act as if you have unmatched confidence and then people will surely have confidence in you. Act as if you have unmatched experience and then people will follow your advice. And act as if you are already a tremendous success, and as sure as I stand here today - you will become successful.”_So, I Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment have a few questions…

1.  **What do you think about when you wake up in the morning?**

When I was asked this question many moons ago, my answer was ‘what can I achieve today that I didn’t yesterday?’

2.  **What do you think when you arrive in the office?**

My answer is always ‘how many deals am I going to close today?’

3.  **What goes through your head before you pick up the phone?**

My answer is ‘I have already closed the deal!’ As arrogant as it may seem, it works for me.So we would like to know, what works for you? What are your answers? And is my statement about positivity being the only way forward accurate?#Recruitment #Zest2Rec #Blogs #Positivity #ActAsIf #Success #Sales #MovingForward
