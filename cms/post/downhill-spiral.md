When things are going well, the contract really doesn’t matter, when they are not people change!If you haven’t agreed from the start what is expected, then you will be heading for a downhill spiral.All of this can normally be avoided with a simple agreement of what is expected from both sides of the table.This should be standard practice, however we all live in the real World, so this is not always the case!So, from the start take your time before entering into a contract of engagement…#Zest2Rec #DownhillSpiral #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
