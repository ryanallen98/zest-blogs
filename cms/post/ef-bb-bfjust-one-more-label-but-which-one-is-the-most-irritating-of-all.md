Like me Iâ€™m sure you love using the odd buzzword, or maybe a lot! But they are soooo yesterday! To be on trend youâ€™ve got have a label!

Lots of postsrecently have been asking what â€˜labelâ€™ is the most irritating. There seemed tobe quite a few! Like thought leader (who is just an expert in their field), visionaryor innovator which, is a wildly overused description for, well just aboutanything!

Letâ€™s face it thereâ€™s a lot of labels out there, they pop up quicker than a new stealth tax!

One of the most irritating is â€˜digital migrantâ€™, (although prefixing anything with digital is annoying as digital is pretty standard stuff these days), which is basically anyone who wasnâ€™t born using a smartphone or tablet before they learnt to talk (and lets face it some still havenâ€™t ðŸ¤” ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜†!).

So, whoâ€™s toblame? Millennials, of course! (and why not, we blame them for most things!)

X Gens (catchingup and learning on the go!) donâ€™t get off lightly though, er â€¦.#Snowflake!

So, next timeyouâ€™re stuck, donâ€™t try and figure it out, instead when in doubt create alabel! and in doing so, it will automatically legitimise anything andeverything we donâ€™t understand.

Job done!
