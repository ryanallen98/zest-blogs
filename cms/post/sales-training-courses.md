I have been on many [recruitment courses](#) over the years having done my time with Corporates, however the biggest issue I found with some of the trainers was, they have never been in recruitment or even sales!Now I understand that if you have done sales, you maybe [able to sell anything](#), but surely you need to have sold a product or service similar to what you claiming to be an expert in?Only having a theory-based view isnâ€™t enough, you must have been through the highs and lows to really appreciate how to tackle those [pain barriers](#).So, do you need to have been in sales to be a sales trainer?#Zest2Rec #SalesTrainer #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
