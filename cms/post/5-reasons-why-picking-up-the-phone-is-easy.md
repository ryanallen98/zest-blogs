1.  Have a number you wish to call.
2.  Pick up the phone as [it doesn't bite](#).
3.  Check there is a dialling tone as [it won't answer back](#).
4.  Start dialling and wait for it to ring.
5.  When someone answers [the fun starts](#).

So, don’t be shy or afraid as it is as simple as this and let’s face it, what’s the worse thing that can happen?What, someone may hang up! Bothered?!?!#Zest2Rec #5Reasons #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
