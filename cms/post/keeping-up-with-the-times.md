How important is it for a business to change with the times?Let’s face it things have changed massively [over the past decade](#) and if you don’t adapt you will get left behind…I get the fact that if ‘it isn’t broken then why try to fix it.’And making changes too quickly can have an adverse effect!So, all you need to do is make a [slight change](#) at a time subtlety in order to not rock the boat.However, all the above said, if we tried to do business in the same way we did in the 90’s would it work?I know that [selling tactics](#) have changed therefore, it is important for the overall business to change…#Zest2Rec #KeepingUpWithTheTimes #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
