How many times have you heard a [sales professional](#) complain about the leads they are given?I understand this may be a valid point on occasions however, surely a lead is what you make it! Particularly if you are on the [front line](#) and your role is to make the first point of contact…So, what to do if someone has a negative view on the leads you provide for the [first stage of a sale](#)?Take them into the office, sit them down, give them a roasting and tell them to get on with it or get out!And ensure they [close the door](#) on the way out…#Zest2Rec #LeadsLeadsLeads #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
