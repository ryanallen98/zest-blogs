We spend most of our life with people at work, so it is important to find something that we enjoy and also to like to people we work with, not everyone thinks like this, I Raj Nasta, can confirm one thing, ‘I will not work with people I don’t like or do a job I don’t enjoy!’Is it down to the product or service you are selling?Or, the people you work with?It maybe even the type of job you are actually doing?Perhaps all of the above, if I knew the answer to all these questions and could get it right each time I placed a candidate, I wouldn’t be writing this blog, I would be retired by now!So, the main question here is what is the best job you have ever had and why?
