As an agency, I believe we should check that candidates we send to potential employers have the right to work in the UK.Recently we have seen many [press releases](#) to say that an agency should not check this. However, if you go to the Government websites it does say you should…Is this just another thing the media are taking out of proportion? Surely, they would never do this… would they?The facts remain that from a credible point of view a [Recruitment Agency](#) should check that its potential placements have the right to work, as the company they work for needs to do this anyway.With [Brexit](#) looming surely, we need to be ahead of the game! Or should we have already been doing this?So, Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know if you carry out relevant checks when taking on new candidates?#Zest2Rec #Brexit #Recruitment #RecruitmentAgency #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #JobBoard
