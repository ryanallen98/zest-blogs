How many of you well rounded sales professionals out there think that Friday afternoon is one of the best times to call a new prospect?Or, would you say it’s Monday as all new prospects are refreshed from a great weekend.Should it make a difference when you call a client?Is it about just catching them at the right time?Some benefits about calling a prospect on a Friday afternoon are:

1.  The client may have had a liquid lunch so in a good mood
2.  It is nearly the weekend so feeling upbeat
3.  Weekly targets have been smashed so has a free moment
4.  A good talking point about plans for the weekend
5.  Nobody else has bothered to call so you are in poll position

I Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment have smashed targets on a Friday on a number of occassions, when is the best time of the week for you to make that call?#zest2recruitment #getonthephone #fridayfeeling #zest2rec
