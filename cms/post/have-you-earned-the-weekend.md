This is a question I ask all my sales consultants on a Friday……The answer is almost always ‘YES?’So, I answer with the response you would expect, ‘WHY?’I don’t need to say anymore… Or do I?Do you think every member of your team deserves the weekend? ‘ouch!’I Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment ask you all, ‘HAVE YOU REALLY EARNED THE WEEKEND?’A Simple ‘YES’ or ‘NO’ is all I need….
