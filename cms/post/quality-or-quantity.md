This is a vast subject that many will say it is surely quality over quantity, however the fact remains that in order to find the quality, it is a numbers game.

They do say, ‘’if you throw enough mud at the wall something will stick?’

It is at that point you have the opportunity to find those gems!

So, as much as I’m all for quality, you need to implement to you day to day role a little bit of quantity.

I would be interested to hear your thoughts on this topic…
