[#WednesdayWisdom](#) has got [Zest 2 Recruitment HQ](#) thinking this morning about the importance of having your ducks in a row. Now, we don’t mean literal ducks! If you have ducks, then trying to get them all to stay in a line would be difficult we feel.We’re talking about having things in order! [The Cambridge Dictionary](#) states this term means _‘to be well organised or well prepared for something that is going to happen.’_ How many of us are able to forecast eventualities and then plan for them whilst keeping calm and collected?This is a [vital skill](#) in business. Things will happen. Things will go wrong at some point. The most crucial factor isn’t the situation itself… it’s how you deal with the situation. We all know that worrying and procrastinating is as effective as trying to [solve algebra by chewing bubble-gum](#) so sitting in the office, waiting for the problem to knock on the door is not going to help you much.However, if you spend the time you have before the unavoidable circumstance happens then you can put yourself in a better position. By being prepared and organised, having everything you need and having sought advice, you can remain [calm and collected](#) safe in the knowledge that you have done everything you should have.Remember, ducks also look like the are gliding seamlessly through the waters whilst they are actually [paddling like crazy](#) beneath the surface. That is probably another similarity to anyone involved in business!In conclusion then, a lot can be learnt from ducks! Hold on… that wasn’t the point, even if it is true.We would be interested to hear your thoughts or hear any examples of a time when you did (or didn’t!) have your ducks in a row.#Zest2Recruitment #Zest2Rec #Recruitment #Blogs #DucksInARow #Beaky
