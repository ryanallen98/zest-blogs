How many times have you decided to [go for a promotion](#) and thought to yourself that you really won’t get it as the [competition is so strong](#)?Then after careful deliberation, you haven’t submitted your application.You then realise the person that got that [particular promotion](#) is just nowhere near as good as you!The purpose behind this blog is… don’t assume what other people will think as, unless you ask them, you won’t really know.Just because someone [appears to be good at their job](#), does it really mean they are?So, next time you are in this position just submit your [application and go for it](#)…#Zest2Rec #Promotion #RajNasta #DontAssume #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
