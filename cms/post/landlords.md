Why should Landlords be able to take your money monthly and not really do a lot!Should they be able to access your office [without your consent](#), particularly if you are up to date with your rent?If all you are trying to do is get on with your [day to day business](#), then really, they should just stay out of your way and let you get on with it!I mean you are paying for the premises, therefore [sticking to the contract](#), then why should they be allowed to walk in unannounced and be nothing more than a busy body!Also, if simple jobs need doing then this should take no more than 2 days to fix, not 2-3 weeks.So, who out there thinks that Landlords should just get the boot?#Zest2Rec #Landlords #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
