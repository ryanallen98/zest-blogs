This is an interesting topic and one of which that is sure to have a [big divide in opinions](#) however, Zest 2 Recruitment have both part-time consultants and full-time consultants and we would be keen to hear the opinions of other employers on this matter…Do you, as an employer, feel you get more from your full-time or part-time employees?A [common assumption](#) is that if someone is part-time and they only work 3 days a week for example, then they only do 60% of the ‘normal’ workload. However, on the other hand, many par-timers will tell you they do a [full-time job in less hours](#).Does this mean they could be considered more productive and efficient than full-time employees and do they need to be more focused and motivated to get things done since they have a more [limited time frame](#)?Full-time team members may sit at their desks for an extra 16 hours or so a week, but would they have much more to show for that time? Are they more likely to put tasks to the bottom of their to-do lists thinking that they ‘always have tomorrow’?Of course, it also goes without saying that ultimately, you will always get the best from your staff if you can [offer flexibility](#)!We would be keen to hear other company’s thoughts on this so please do like, share and comment.#Zest2Recruitment #Zest2Rec #Recruitment #PartTime #FullTime #AreYouFlexible
