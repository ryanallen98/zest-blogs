Is it the fact that you have simply closed the sale?

Or, is it making sure you have a future client on board forever?

Nowadays too many sales professionals don’t see the bigger picture and just think of the short-term target ahead, so much to the point that they can miss what the future holds…

Do we put this down to the sales person on the phone or the training they have received I wonder?

We can investigate what makes a good ‘closer’ although it is really what comes after it and the relationship you have with the client and for how long…
