I get that to grow something big, you need to focus most of your energy in certain directions, however putting your [‘all your eggs in one basket’](#) can lead to disaster.This particularly applies to small businesses that are start-ups and have [limited revenue](#) coming in.If you have a few [sources of income](#), it alleviates the pressure and allows you to focus on the growth of the business, therefore making you much more productive.This does not apply if you have a business booming, just those that are struggling to put hand to mouth....#Zest2Rec #HandToMouth #RajNasta #Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment
