Is recruitment going [back in time](#)?We have become too reliant on the internet, texting, [social media](#) in as much as we probably forget how things were done in the 90â€™s.Even in 2000, CVs were sent by fax and through the post.I used to do breakfast and afternoon tea runs, drive rounds to win new clients, leaflet drops to source new candidates, and maybe even put an advert in the newspapers.Have we forgotten that all these things still work along with just [picking up the phone](#)?Raj Nasta of Zest 2 Recruitment would like to know what works for you now and if you still use the [traditional methods](#)?#Zest2Rec #BackToTheFuture #Recruitment #JobBoards #Zest2Recruitment #RajNasta
