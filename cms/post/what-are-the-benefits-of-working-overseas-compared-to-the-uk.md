Well, the first and most obvious answer given the past few days is the weather, having said that is the grass greener on the other side?Benefits of working overseas are:

1.  The glorious sunshine most of the time.
2.  Tax free pay in certain parts of the World.
3.  A completely different pace of life.
4.  Cheaper living costs.
5.  See different cultures.

Benefits of working in the UK are:

1.  Pay the government an average of 35% of your income.
2.  Fantastic Healthcare system.
3.  The amazing 5 hours a day of rain.
4.  State of the art public transport system.
5.  Queue for almost everything.
