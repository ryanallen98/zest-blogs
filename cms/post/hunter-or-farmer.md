Our MD, Raj Nasta, has been questioning whether sales professionals that require a high basic show a lack of confidence in their own sales ability? He blogs…“This is a question I have been asking myself for over 10 years and being a commission-only business owner I throw the question out there for discussion…On a monthly basis my office will interview in excess of 1000 sales professionals and the main thing we always hear is, ‘I am the best sales person out there and will always exceed my targets’ and some will even go to the extreme of, ‘I regularly exceed my target by 200-250%.’This superlative sales professional may be on a basic salary of £30,000 with an OTE of £38,000 however, they are generating the company a solid GP of £150,000 per annum. If you are that confident in your ability, would you not prefer to scrap the basic altogether and earn double this as the company will have the flexibility to pay that? I know I would and most sales executives with total belief in themselves will do this.So I ask the question to all the sales professional out there, double the money with little or no basic or big basic with little or no commission?”#Zest2Recruitment #Recruitment #Sales #BasicOrCommission #HunterOrFarmer
